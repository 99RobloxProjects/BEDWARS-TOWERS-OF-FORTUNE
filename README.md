# BEDWARS-TOWERS-OF-FORTUNE
Steps to set up:
- Create a custom match
- Put all the scripts from the src folder into your BedWars code editor with their names matching the exact names from the src folder (don't include file extensions in BedWars script editor names, or this will not work! and make sure to keep the names exact)
- Run and enjoy, or if you'd like to make it your own: feel free to customise the configs in each script or fork this project to your liking

Inspired the Towers of Fortune gamemode from popular minigame-focused Minecraft servers
